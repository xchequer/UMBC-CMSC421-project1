In this project, you are going to implement a number of functions to 
create a simple linux shell interface to perform basic linux commands
*/

DEFINE THE FUNCTION PROTOTYPES
user_prompt_loop()
get_user_command()
parse_command()
execute_command()

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
    /*
    Write the main function that checks the number of argument passed to ensure 
    no command-line arguments are passed; if the number of argument is greater 
    than 1 then exit the shell with a message to stderr and return value of 1
    otherwise call the user_prompt_loop() function to get user input repeatedly 
    until the user enters the "exit" command.

/*
user_prompt_loop():
Get the user input using a loop until the user exits, prompting the user for a command.
Gets command and sends it to a parser, then compares the first element to the two
different commands ("/proc", and "exit"). If it's none of the commands, 
send it to the execute_command() function. If the user decides to exit, then exit 0 or exit 
with the user given value.

    loop:
        1. prompt the user to type command by printing >>
        2. get the user input using get_user_command() function 
        3. parse the user input using parse_command() function 
        Example: 
            user input: "ls -la"
            parsed output: ["ls", "-la", NULL]
        4. compare the first element of the parsed output to "/proc"and "exit"
        5. if the first element is "/proc" then you have the open the /proc file system 
           to read from it
            i) concat the full command:
                Ex: user input >>/proc /process_id_no/status
                    concated output: /proc/process_id_no/status
            ii) read from the file line by line. you may user fopen() and getline() functions
            iii) display the following information according to the user input from /proc
                a) Get the cpu information if the input is /proc/cpuinfo
                - Cpu Mhz
                - Cache size
                - Cpu cores
                - Address sizes
                b) Get the number of currently running processes from /proc/loadavg
                c) Get how many seconds your box has been up, and how many seconds it has been idle from /proc/uptime
                d) Get the following information from /proc/process_id_no/status
                - the vm size of the virtual memory allocated the vbox 
                - the most memory used vmpeak 
                - the process state
                - the parent pid
                - the number of threads
                - number of voluntary context switches
                - number of involuntary context switches
                e) display the list of environment variables from /proc/process_id_no/environ
                f) display the performance information if the user input is /proc/process_id_no/sched
        6. if the first element is "exit" the use the exit() function to terminate the program
        7. otherwise pass the parsed command to execute_command() function 
        8. free the allocated memory using the free() function
